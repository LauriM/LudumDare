=========

Gameplay was missing a bit, but I have nice effects all over the screen!

For this jam I didn't have full time to work on the game, as I missed the first 12 hours, but in the end this was a success, even that I didn't get a "full" game out.

Controls
========

* wasd
* e to halt. (debugging)
* space to zoom


Ideas / todo
============

## bugs

* origos are invalid
* player can't die
* where is the theme?!?
* HUD missing

## todo

* no planets on top of each other
* planets have invalid origos ( position.x/y + radius should help)
* new ship model and transparency
* corruption on memory! (entities)

## Gameplay

* collect 10 items from the level
* there is also fuel on the level
* limited fuel, use physics to get away
